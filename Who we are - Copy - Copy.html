            <h1 class="aligned-heading">How We Started</h1>
            <p>Carolina Cold Ones burst onto the scene when Matthew Moyer, a fraternity brother with a keen eye for fashion (or at least for less atrocious fraternity shirts), decided he had endured enough of the overpriced, underwhelming, and slow-as-molasses t-shirt services. With the enthusiasm of a freshman at their first tailgate, Matthew began producing shirts for his fraternity brothers, quickly extending his reach to the wardrobes of his friends and family as well. He wasn’t merely splashing paint on fabric; he was rescuing his brothers from the fashion blunders of dull, overpriced tees.</p>
